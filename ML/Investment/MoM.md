## Back to basics (Part 1.1): What is time value of money?

    How can compare Revenue in 1997 and 2009?
    I asked to lend me 100$ and I will pay 100$ in year

    Dollar today is worth more than a dollar tomorrow

    Why does money have time value?
        1. Postponed consumtion. You can use for your own consumtion. 
        2. Expected inflation
        3. Risk

    All above - opportunity cost - that's why it's positive rate (i.e. interest)


### How to find future value?
    Funds invested * opportunity cost
    After year = 100+100*0.05= 105;
    After 3 years = 100*(1.05)^3 - compounding

    Future value = interest rate;

### Finding the present value of a cash flow
    Presert value = 3 years value / (1.05)^3;

    Discount rate = Interest rate =  Opportunity cost of capital
